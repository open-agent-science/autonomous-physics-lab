# Autonomous Physics Lab

Generate. Simulate. Falsify. Reuse.

Autonomous Physics Lab (APL) is an open-source infrastructure for generating,
testing, simulating, falsifying, and reusing physics hypotheses.

APL is not a chatbot. It is a public verification engine for physics ideas.

## Positioning

The long-term goal is not to claim a "theory of everything" from day one.
The goal is to build infrastructure for systematic theory search in physics.

The project combines three cores:

1. A hypothesis engine for proposing and testing candidate formulas or models.
2. A public knowledge base for storing hypotheses, claims, experiments, and results.
3. An open agent task network so humans and external agents can contribute reproducible work.

## First MVP

The first MVP is `Pendulum Formula Discovery`.

It should:

1. Generate exact pendulum period ratio data.
2. Fit simple approximation families.
3. Compare candidate models.
4. Score accuracy and complexity.
5. Produce a reproducible Markdown report.

## Status

The repository currently has a working first vertical slice:

- architecture and documentation are in place;
- the public knowledge layout is defined;
- the pendulum formula discovery MVP works end-to-end;
- structured artifact validation and repo-wide checks are implemented.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md),
[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md), and
[docs/implementation-plan.md](docs/implementation-plan.md).

## Planning Docs

Use these files to continue the project without guessing:

- [docs/implementation-plan.md](docs/implementation-plan.md) for phased strategy
- [docs/next-steps.md](docs/next-steps.md) for the immediate working queue
- [docs/backlog.md](docs/backlog.md) for medium-term and deferred tasks
